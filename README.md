# Repetita Versio

A versatile looper for the Versio platform.

## Etymology

Repetita: from Latin Repetere for “repeat” (as in Repetita Iuvant, meaning “repeating does good”)

Versio: from Latin for “versatile”

“Versatile repetitor”

## Controls:

Knob 1 > [blend]
Knob 2 > [start]
Knob 3 > [tone]
Knob 4 > [flip]
knob 5 > [decay]
Knob 6 > [rate]
Knob 7 > [thaw]
ABC > [channel]
XYZ > [flow]
FSU > [trigger]

- [blend] dry/wet balance control.
- [start] sets the loop starting/retriggering point.
- [tone] applies a band-pass resonant filter to the dry signal, pre-recording:
    ccw > no filter;
    cw > cutoff at 1000 Hz.
- [flip] flips the buffer by changing the loop length:
    ccw > full loop length but reversed, goes backwards;
    noon > smallest loop length, goes forward;
    cw > full loop length, goes forward.
- [decay] controls the level of decay of the recorded signal:
    ccw > instant decay;
    cw > no decay.
- [rate] the rate of reproduction of the buffer:
    ccw > slowest rate (0.2x);
    noon > normal rate (1x);
    cw > fastes rate (4x).
- [thaw] progressively freezes/thaws the buffer:
    ccw > completely frozen (no recording);
    cw > completely thawed (recording).
- [channel] the top switch set the channel currently controlled:
    left > left channel;
    center > both channels are controlled;
    right > right channel.
- [flow] the bottom switch sets how the play is triggered:
    left > momentary, no restart, slowly accelerates/decelerates while changing the pitch;
    center > one shot, restarts at loop start point;
    right > continuously loops.
- [trigger] gate/trigger, depends on the [flow] switch.

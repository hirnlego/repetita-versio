# Repetita Versio

A versatile looper for the Versio platform.

## Etymology

Repetita: from Latin Repetere for “repeat” (as in Repetita Iuvant, meaning “repeating does good”)

Versio: from Latin for “versatile”

“Versatile repetitor”

## Controls

- Knob 1 > [blend]
- Knob 2 > [start]
- Knob 3 > [tone]
- Knob 4 > [size]
- knob 5 > [decay]
- Knob 6 > [rate]
- Knob 7 > [freeze]
- ABC > [channel]
- XYZ > [flow]
- FSU > [trigger]

**Blend:** Dry/wet balance control.

**Start:** Sets the loop starting/retriggering point.

**Tone:** Applies a band-pass resonant filter to the dry signal, pre-recording:
- ccw > no filter;
- cw > cutoff at 1000 Hz.

**Size:** Changes the loop size:
- ccw > full loop length but reversed, goes backwards;
- noon > note mode;
- cw > full loop length, goes forward.

**Decay:** Controls the level of decay of the recorded signal:
- ccw > instant decay;
- cw > no decay.

**Rate:** The rate of reproduction of the buffer. In note mode, controls the transposition (from -4 octaves to +1 octave):
- ccw > slowest rate (0.2x);
- noon > normal rate (1x);
- cw > fastes rate (4x).

**Freeze:** Progressively freezes the buffer:
- ccw > completely un-frozen (recording);
- cw > completely frozen (no recording).

**Channel:** The top switch set the channel currently controlled:
- left > left channel;
- center > both channels are controlled;
- right > right channel.

**Flow:** The bottom switch sets how the play is triggered:
- left > momentary, no restart, slowly accelerates/decelerates while changing the pitch;
- center > one shot, restarts at loop start point;
- right > continuously loops.

**Trigger:** Gate/trigger, depends on the Flow switch.

- bug; fix buffering leds when resetting the looper (does the looper reset correctly at all?)
- bug; fix gate mode when changing the relation between read and write heads (loop length, ratio, freeze)
- bug: don't use TimeHeldMs() for handling button hold, use the internal clock
- rework the size parameter to account for the longest loop
- flanger mode -> rate
- parameters affecting both loopers at the same time should be offsets of each looper's base parameters
- nice to have: parameters pick-up, so the parameters don't have an immediate effect when switching the selected looper
- clickless activation of the filter
- button + mix knob = input gain

# TODO

- bug: leds not displaying correctly the loop
- bug: fix trigger (all modes)
- bug: sometimes when removing the input signal in backwards reproduction, the buffer doesn't completely clear
- clean up start position changes (zapper sound)
- convert gate mode to record button
- global mode > settings page
- in delay mode, the unused buffer should be empty (tried, not good)
- reset global parameters when booting with the button pressed

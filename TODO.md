# TODO

- bug: leds not displaying correctly the loop
- bug: click in looper mode when length < buffer and rate != 1
- bug: in delay mode, when re-triggering one-shot loops, there's an artifact at
    the beginning (end?) of the loop
- clean up start position changes (zapper sound)
- in delay mode, the unused buffer should be empty (tried, not good)
- reset global parameters when booting with the button pressed
